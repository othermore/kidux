"""Updates from the panel, by keyboard: looked for, found, installed (plan step 9.8).

The package it updates is made in the machine and served from a directory
(`kidux-as canary`); the real archive is never touched. Then the System
page's Advanced settings (D52): Chromium's options, set from the command
line before the panel opened, shown on their page, and saved again from it.

Last, Debian's daily upgrade fenced as the panel's install is (D115), with
a stand-in for it that only leaves a mark and waits, so that nothing needs
to be there to install: under Leo's session it is skipped; when Leo logs
out the daemon starts it; and Leo, signing in while it runs, waits on the
sign-in screen and gets in once it has finished.
