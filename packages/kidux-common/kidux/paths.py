"""Every path, group and bus name Kidux uses, in one place.

Nothing else in Kidux may spell a path out. Four programs read and write the
same files — the greeter, the lock screen, the launcher and the daemon — and a
path written twice is a path that will eventually disagree with itself.

Every root can be overridden by an environment variable. That is what makes the
tests possible: they point the state root at a temporary directory instead of
at the real one, which is root-owned and holds the family's actual settings.
The overrides are for tests and development only; an installed system sets none
of them.
