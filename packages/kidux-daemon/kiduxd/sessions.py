"""The clock for each child's session (daemon.md sections 7 and 8).

The daemon learns about sessions from logind and keeps time for each one
here. Nothing a child's session runs is involved: the launcher can be killed
and the clock keeps running.

A session is either **counting** (unlocked: time is charged), **stopped**
(locked: nothing is charged) or on **grace** (unlocked by an adult for a few
minutes so the child can save, charged to nobody, and locked again when the
grace runs out). Time is measured on the monotonic clock, so changing the
wall clock during a session changes nothing about that session; the wall
clock is only used to decide which day it is.

Everything is flushed to usage.toml (and access.toml, whose bank changes in
manual mode) on every tick, so a power cut, a crash or a deliberate reboot
costs at most one tick of counting.
