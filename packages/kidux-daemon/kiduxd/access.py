"""Policy and time: how much a child may use, and what using it costs.

Pure functions over plain values and an injected clock (daemon.md section 7).
No D-Bus, no files, no clock of its own: everything here has a way to be
quietly wrong, so everything here is tested against a clock the tests control.

Seconds are whole numbers throughout. The session tracker carries the
fraction of a second between ticks itself, so nothing is lost and nothing
here has to reason about floats.
