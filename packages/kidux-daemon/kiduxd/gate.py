"""Who may call what, and on whose behalf (daemon.md section 2, D27).

Two halves, kept in one module so that every rule about permission is in one
place and each one has a test that tries to get past it.

**polkit decides who may call a method.** `ACTIONS` maps every method to one
of three polkit actions, or to none for the handful anyone may call. The
rules that say which users hold which action ship in
`/usr/share/polkit-1/rules.d/50-kidux.rules`.

**The daemon decides which child a call may touch**, because polkit sees the
action and the caller and never the arguments. A child allowed to ask about
their own time could otherwise ask about a sibling's, and an unlocked panel
could delete the account that owns the machine.
