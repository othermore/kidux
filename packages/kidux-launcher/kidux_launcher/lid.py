"""The lid: the screen off while it is closed, on again when it opens (D61).

The lid is an input switch the kernel lists (`kidux.hardware.lid_devices`),
readable by anyone since `kidux-session`'s udev rule; the launcher reads it
in GLib's main loop and asks the compositor, through `wlopm`
(wlr-output-power-management), to power the machine's own panel off or on.
Closing it also locks the session, as the Lock button does (D67), so that a
laptop closed and carried away is locked when it is opened. Nothing else
changes: brightness stays what it was, windows stay where they are, and an
external screen stays on. logind is told to do nothing about the lid
(session.md, section 6), so closing it is never a way out of a time limit.
